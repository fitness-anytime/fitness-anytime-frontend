## Overview

These days, fitness classes can be held anywhere- a park, an unfinished basement or a garage- not just at a traditional gym. Certified fitness instructors need an easy way to take the awkwardness out of attendance taking and client payment processing.

While you could use several mobile apps to accomplish this, **AnywhereFitness** is the all-in-one solution to meet your ‚Äúon-location‚Äù fitness class needs. AnywhereFitness makes it painless for Instructors and Clients alike to hold and attend Fitness classes wherever they might be held.

### The App

Instructors can take attendance, request and process payments, create virtual ‚Äúpunch passes‚Äù for each type of class offered, alert clients of cancellations or location changes and so much more. Clients can easily find out information on classes - location, class size, start time and duration, as well as reschedule or cancel an upcoming appointment or reservation right from the mobile app.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## The process

- Built flow chart with Figma to visualize components needed
- Created file structure to compartmentalize tasks
- Assigned tasks to team members depending on strengths
- Held daily meetings to pair program and regroup
- Created basic functionality, then added style and launched
- Connected front end to back end

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Node.js
- MUI library
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What We've Learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("üéâ");
};
```

### Continued development

- Link payment app
- Allow instructors to refund payments
- Allow both instructors and clients to provide feedback

### Useful resources

- Figma (https://www.figma.com) - This is where we began our design, creating a flow chart to visualize every component we would need.
- VSCode live share (VSC extension) - This extension allowed our team to code together and see each other's changes in real time. Very useful!
- Zoom (https://www.zoom.com) - Useful for daily meetings, screensharing, and team building.
- MUI library (https://www.mui.com) - Great for styling.
