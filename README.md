## Overview

These days, fitness classes can be held anywhere- a park, an unfinished basement or a garage- not just at a traditional gym. Certified fitness instructors need an easy way to take the awkwardness out of attendance taking, and user tracking for their classes.

While you could use several mobile apps to accomplish this, **AnywhereFitness** is the all-in-one solution to meet your “on-location” fitness class needs. AnywhereFitness makes it painless for Instructors and Clients alike to hold and attend Fitness classes wherever they might be held.

### The App

- Instructors can take attendance, create virtual “punch passes” for each type of class offered, alert clients of cancellations or location changes and so much more.

- Clients can easily find out information on classes - location, class size, start time and duration, as well as reschedule or cancel an upcoming appointment or reservation right from the mobile app.

## Fast Instructions for running this project

- You need React and Node.js on your local environment.
- clone project
- in terminal `npm install`
- then `npm start`
- find all necesssary imports at the top of each file. Be sure you load...
  - npm i yup
  - npm i styled-components
  - npm i axios
  - npm i react-router-dom
  - npm i @mui/material
- Above all Have Fun!

## General Instructions for React Apps

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## The process

- Built flow chart with Figma to visualize components needed
- Created file structure to compartmentalize tasks
- Assigned tasks to team members depending on strengths
- Held daily meetings to pair program and regroup
- Created basic functionality, then added style and launched
- Connected front end to back end

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) - date format and date utils library.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Mui](https://mui.com/) - React component library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styled components

### Continued development

- Link payment app
- Allow instructors to refund payments
- Allow both instructors and clients to provide feedback

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - This is where we began our design, creating a flow chart to visualize every component we would need.
- VSCode live share (VSC extension) - This extension allowed our team to code together and see each other's changes in real time. Very useful!
- [Zoom](https://www.zoom.com) - Useful for daily meetings, screensharing, and team building.
- [MUI](https://www.mui.com) - Great for pre-made styling, React component library.
- [Undraw](https://undraw.co/) - "Open-source illustrations for any idea you can imagine and create"
